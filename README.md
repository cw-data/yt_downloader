# YouTube video downloader

`main.py` is based on Tiff in Tech's video: https://youtu.be/EMlM6QTzJo0

`main.py` is a command line python program built on the `pytube` module that downloads a .mp4 of a specified youtube video. `main.py` prompts the user to input the URL of the youtube video they want to download. Once the user enters the URL of their target youtube video, `main.py` calls its only function `Download()`. `Download()` takes one parameter: `link`, which is a URL to a youtube video. `Download()` instantiates a `youtubeObject` which is a `YouTube` object from pytube. Next, `Download()` finds the highest available resolution version of the youtube video by calling the `.streams.get_highest_resolution()` method on `youtubeObject`. Finally, `Download()` calls the pytube's `.download()` method which saves the youtube video as .mp4 into the project's working directory unless another target directory is specified. Once the video has downloaded, `Download()` prints a success message to the terminal and exits. `Download()`'s methods are called in a `try` block that only proceeds if the user inputs a valid youtube video URL. If the user enters anything other than a valid youtube URL, `Download()` proceeds to an `except` block prints an error mesage before exiting the program.
